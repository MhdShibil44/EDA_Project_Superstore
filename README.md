# EDA_Project_Superstore
Analyzed retail sales data to uncover trends, segment performance, and profit insights using Python. From time-series sales patterns to category-wise visualizations, this project highlights how data-driven decisions can enhance business growth.
# 🛒 Exploratory Data Analysis of Superstore Sales  
**Uncovering Key Business Insights Using Python**

This project showcases a deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the popular Superstore dataset to identify valuable trends in **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Customer Segments** across regions, categories, and time. The goal is to simulate how businesses can use data to make smarter, insight-driven decisions.

## 📌 Project Highlights

### 🔍 Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Loaded a real-world retail dataset with over **10,000+ records**.
- Verified data types, handled missing values, and converted date fields for time-series analysis.
- Utilized **custom helper modules** (`Basic_Stats`, `ConInt_Z_Score`) for enhanced statistical insight.

### 📈 Deep-Dive Exploratory Analysis
- Category-wise and region-wise **Sales** & **Profit** distributions.
- Analyzed **monthly and yearly trends** using resampling techniques.
- Isolated underperforming entries where **Sales < $250**.
- Visualized key patterns using:
  - 📊 Bar charts  
  - 🥧 Pie charts  
  - 📦 Boxplots  
  - 📉 Histograms  
  - 📍 Scatterplots

## 📌 Notable Visual Insights

- **Central region** shows strong sales but fluctuating profit margins.
- Sub-categories like **Technology vs. Furniture** revealed unexpected profit-to-sales dynamics.
- **Sales and Profit** have a **non-linear correlation**, highlighted via scatterplot trends.
- Low-profit areas and underperforming products were clearly identified for optimization.
